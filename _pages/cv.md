Research Projects
======
* __Predicting microRNA-disease associations from exosome-coated microRNA(Leader)__, 2023.7-present
  * _**Description**_: The project aims to dsicover disease-associated miRNA more precisely by combining exosome-miRNA related data through heterogeneous graph network

* __OdinDTA–A model for predicting drug–target binding affinity(Leader)__, 2023.3-2023.7
  * _**Description**_:The project aims to enhance the accuracy, interpretability, and generalization capability of drug-target affinity prediction tasks by employing a model that combines mutual attention mechanisms and pre-training tasks.
  * _**Contribution**_:\
    * Through the mutual attention mechanism with shared weights, we address the issue of insufficient simulation of complex interactions between drugs and targets and provide the model with good interpretability.\
    * We apply pre-trained protein models to learn from a large amount of unlabeled protein data, thereby resolving the issue of insufficient richness in the protein features.\
    * Generalized Aggregation Graph Networ (GEN) is used to extract deeper topological structural information
  
* __Radiation resistance with AR degradation(Member)__, 2022.12-present\
_Research project led by Prof.Deng in Shanghai Jiao Tong University_\
_*Founded by The National Natural Science Foundation of China_
  * _**Description**_: The project aims to explore the mechanism through which radiotherapy and Androgen Receptor (AR) degradation synergistically promote the stem-like CD8 positive T cells, as well as to develop innovative drugs.
  * _**Contribution**_:Literature review, data processing, construction of protein expression systems, conducting flow cytometry analysis experiments, Western Blot experiments, qPCR experiments, cell experiments, animal experiments, etc.
  
* __Undergraduate Thesis–Flavonoid FV-429 inhibits metastasis in human prostate cancer__, 2020.11-2021.5\
_Research project led by Prof.Guo in China Pharmaceutical University_
  * _**Description**_: The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the glycolysis mechanism in the inhibition of human prostate cancer cell metastasis by the flavonoid derivative FV-429 derived from wogonin, and provide a theoretical basis for new drug development.
  * _**Contribution**_:\
    * We found that FV-429 inhibits the proliferation, invasion, and migration of human prostate cancer cells.
    * FV-429 can reverse the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenomenon in prostate tumors.
    * We ultimately concluded that FV-429 reverses the EMT phenomenon and ultimately impacts the invasion and migration of tumor cells in human prostate cancer by inhibiting glycolysis
    
  
* 5-FU resistance mediated by FOS gene and its mechanism(Leader), 2019.2-2020.12\
_Research project assisted by Prof.Zhao in China Pharmaceutical University_\
_*Founded by National College Students’ Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program_
  * Description: The aim of this study is to investigate the relevance and role of the FOS gene in the process of 5-FU resistance in colorectal cancer, and to explore the downstream regulated proteins influenced by it.
  * Contribution: Literature review, data processing, Conducting biochemical experiments, cellular experiments, and animal experiments, etc.
