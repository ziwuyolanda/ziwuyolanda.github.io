During my time in university, I joined the school orchestra. Due to the limited number of piano players needed, 
I opted to learn to play the cello within the orchestra. This experience lasted for approximately two years, 
during which I participated in events like New Year's concerts. I find the sound of the cello to be quite distinctive, 
resonating with your chest as you play, which is truly marvelous.
